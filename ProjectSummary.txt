01_EDA_cleaning_earthquake - data exploration and visualization of damage assessment data in python notebook
02_geospatial_mapping_analysis_earthquake - computed distance for generalised model in python notebook
03_nosampling_allmodels_lgb_gbm_rf - Decision trees models are run in python. Data used from clean_data folder, models built seperately for 
                             undersampling and oversampling are not included here due to their poor performance. This is subject to further study.
                             all outputs of non sampling models are saved in their respective folders.
04_nosampling_allmodels_ord_multi - Logistics models are run in R. Data used from clean_data folder. All outputs of non sampling models are saved in their respective folders.
05_ensemble - Prediction from decision tree and logistic models are used as input data to improve prediction further. Decision tree is used as model for ensemble. This is a final outcome of use case 1 & 3.
06_ClusteringKmeans - R based of code for selected numerical feature clustering
07_ClusteringLCA    - R based code numerical binned feature & selected categorical feature clustering
utils               -  compiled all functions used in python notebook + .py files

All these codes were run in RCC - Midway 2 - Uchicago Facility:
